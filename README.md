# Moscow-house-price

## Introduction

Given the house price data in Moscow from 2011-2015, the goal of this project is to predict the house prices in Moscow from year 2015-2016. This is a competition currently hosted by kaggle.

This notebook is not copied from any other kernels in kaggles, and it scores top 18% in public leader board (Team name: STL) (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/leaderboard/public?asOf=2017-5-16). If the results from rank 91 - 266 (these results are all copied from the .csv of the same public kaggle kernel) are not counted, this one could even rank up to top 10% in current public leader board.
